    <h3>Calendar NG2</h3>
    <p>
      A pure angular2 / javascript calendar plugin, non-dependent on any other resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Local Meter Reader</h3>
    <p>
      An application that runs on a ConnectKey device that crawls thru the network grabbing all meter information for all SNMP enabled devices and sends it off to web / mobile application UI.
    </p>
    <h3>"The Internet"</h3>
    <p>
      The first ever application to allow ConnectKey users the opportunity to surf the web via custom bookmarks and quick surfing.
    </p>
    <h5>Spinoff</h5>
    <p>
      On the way of creating this application I prototyped a browser within a browser angular application that is available on GitHub. It had it's limitations being that many top websites block access to their content from within iFrames.
    </p>
    <h3 id="business-cards">
      Business Cards
    </h3>
    <p>
      An application for Xerox ConnectKey to allow users to enter business cards, print them, email directly to a user on a business card and much more.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a href="http://groupleapp.herokuapp.com/#/" target="_blank">Grouple</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Social app for getting together with friends and participating in events. When you propose an event in Grouple, you don't invite friends, you invite your groups. As development continues users will be able to do things like pull up a map of their local area and see all public events going on and click to be brought directly to the event profile and get in on the action. Grouple is for promoting socialization outside of the realm of media. Options like minimum and maximum participants, recurring events, automating the rescheduling of events to better fit all potential event attendees, and much more make Grouple unique. Users earn badges and levels while using the app, which serves as an extra incentive to get out and active in their community. Event messaging, group messaging and user messaging keep communication organized and to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grouple also sports a settings panel that lets you enable or disable both push notifications and email notifications for everything that happens within the app to help keep you in the know to what is going on.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>Disc Golf Website</h3>
    <p>
      Created an interactive disc golf website where users could register, login and record their rounds at various disc golf parks that were put into the server. Features were: course standings where you could sort by a multitude of statistics, and personal statistics page breaking down your skills over time. I also connected the site to an open source php forum for the community to use for meet ups at local courses, or just talk about disc golf in general.
    </p>
    <h2>Plans</h2>
    <p>Currently working on Grouple in my extra time. Right now I am implementing previous features from the android app. Once those are completed I have many plans that are going to bring the application to the next level!
      I plan to get it in all marketplaces as well as live on web by the end of December.</p>
    <p>Looking to work as a front-end / full-stack developer for a company that raises the bar when it comes to creating web apps. Also willing to take on freelance projects in the meantime!</  p>
