    <h2>Volleyball</h2>
    <p>
      I tried out for the volleyball team my freshman year in high school. Been in love ever since. Throughout high school it was my goal to play on a division 1 college team. I was extremely adamant about this and worked as hard as I could, playing and training year round. In 2010 I was recruited to play for the IPFW Mastodons a team I had looked up to throughout high school. In 2007 they made it to the NCAA D1 National Championship, to fall just short of the national title, losing 3-1 to UC-Irvine. I remember watching every point of that game, dreaming what it would be like to play on a team of that caliber.</p>

      I got my chance to live out my dream! I played on the team for 5 seasons, hitting some unexpected bumps along the way. My first year of college I red-shirted to gain experience, which was great, got to learn under the wing of some great players, it really grew my knowledge of the game.

      Through my next few seasons on the team I got knocked down a bit, battling thru 3 ankle sprains, and a shoulder surgery, which took me out of the entire 2013-2014 season. The next season, my senior season academically, I fought through, seeing some action and traveling across the country playing volleyball. All said and done I wish I could have stayed on my feet a little more, but I got a great degree from Purdue and have no regrets!

      I now pursue the beach volleyball, it's more of a game of finesse than power, and the sand is a lot easier on the ankles :) ! I am currently taking some rest to heal up a wrist injury from this past summer of play. I look forward to getting back out to the beach next summer!

    <h2>Summer 2016</h2>
    <p>
      Memorial day weekend I had a major setback in my attempts to get back out to the beach. I dislocated and fractured my left elbow taking me out of volleyball for 3 months minimum. In addition to this I developed cubital tunnel and ulnar subluxation in my right elbow. I'm doing my best to rehabilitate but am unsure when I will be back to full health. I'm optimistic I'll be able to get my upper body back together this upcoming winter and get back out to the beach in 2017 stronger than ever.
