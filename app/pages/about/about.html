    <h3>Me</h3>
    <p>
      All around enjoy the outdoors, love sports and pushing my body to new limits. Javascript is my craft. I bring to life elegant cross-platform, responsive and performant web apps.

      Choose to make this portfolio from pretty much scratch, I think there is value in doing things without reliance on frameworks that abstract away the true work.

    <h3>Mierze</h3>
    <p>Mierze is short for Mierzejewski, my grandmother's maiden name. She always knew I loved the name and she came to pass in 2013. Since then I've adopted the name as an alias in memory of her.</p>

    <h3>Vegetarian</h3>
    <p>
      Interesting fact about me, I've been a vegetarian since 2009.
